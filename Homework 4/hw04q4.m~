b = [2; 1; 5]

%Solve using MATLAB 'backslash'
x=M/b' %Not sure what x_ref is supposed to be. Which is the analytical solution?
%norm(x-xref)

%Solve with MakeLU
[L,U] = MakeLU(M);
y = L/b';
x = U/y'
%norm(x-xref)

%Solve with MakePLU. P^-1*M=P^-1*b
[L1,U1,P1] = MakePLU(M);

b1 = P1*b;
y = L/b1';
x = U/y'
